# Solar Power Bank

## Objective
- Design and build a solar-powered portable charger with an OLED interface and dual USB outputs.

## Features
- OLED Display the output battery percentage, solar wattage, and performance
- Dual USB Output Board so that two devices can be charged at once
- Traditional USB input for traditional charging

## Tools/Materials
- ESP32 Microcontroller
- Solder Station
- Enclosure (Material to be decided; Most likely 3D Printed)
- Arduino IDE

## Planning
- Creating a list of materials and budgeting
  - Right now, the total cost for a unit looks to be about ~$50
- Using a breadboard to get a rough estimate of the wiring and help with debugging firmware
- Use Autodesk to plan out the dimensions of the Powerbank and design the enclosure

## Considerations
- Regulate input so that the Li-ion battery is not overcharged.
- Make sure the powerbank does not overheat.
